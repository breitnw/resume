  % PRL-PRG research
  \begin{rItem}{Research Assistant}{PRL-PRG}{Jan. 2024}{Sep. 2024}
    \item Collaborated on the development of a new infrastructure for just-in-time compilation of the R programming language
    \item Aided in transition from C++ to a Java compile server, focusing specifically on RDS serialization
    \item After completion of RDS writer, integrated serialization system as a communication protocol between C++ frontend and
    Java backend, enabling comprehensive integration testing via package compilation  \end{rItem}

  % Minnetonka Research
  \begin{rItem}{Independent Researcher}{Minnetonka Research}{Sep. 2022}{May 2023}
    \item Project title: {\em Improving sphere blending performance for fluid simulation applications using ray-marched rendering}
    \item Worked with Vulkan to develop ray-marched and mesh rendering engines, utilizing a smooth-min distance field and a marching-cubes algorithm, respectively, for sphere blending.
    \item Compared performance metrics for both algorithms, highlighting efficiency of ray-marching
    \item Twin Cities Regional Science Fair: awarded blue ribbon (first place in Systems Software category), purple ribbon (advancement to State), and Stockholm Junior Water Prize

  % Northwestern trace-contracts research
  \begin{rItem}{Programming Languages Research Intern}{Northwestern Univ., \it Evanston, IL}{Jan. 2025}{Present}
    \item Design and conduct a Rational Programmer (RP) experiment to investigate the pragmatics of trace contracts
    \item Examine the space of strategies for replacing a program's integration tests with trace contracts by encoding those strategies with RP algorithms, implemented in Racket
    \item Quantify RP performance by measuring the quality of resulting test suites with mutation analysis
    % TODO mention SURG grant?
  \end{rItem}

  % PRL-PRG research
  \begin{rItem}{Compilers Research Intern}{Czech Technical University, \it Prague, CZ}{Jan. 2024}{Sep. 2024}
    \item Collaborated on the development of a new infrastructure for just-in-time compilation of R language
    \item Aided in transition from C++ to Java compile server, focusing on RDS serializer implementation
    \item Integrated serializer as a communication protocol between C++ frontend and Java backend
    \item Constructed large-scale integration tests using new communication protocol, comparing server and client-side bytecode to expose numerous inconsistencies

    % ADDITIONAL NOTES
    % RDS writer PR: https://github.com/PRL-PRG/r-compile-server/pull/16

    % Integration test branch: https://github.com/PRL-PRG/r-compile-server/tree/backend-rds
    %
    % 1. Implemented serialization in the GNU R bytecode format, entailing a mapping from our bytecode to the GNU R standard, a compliant instruction serialization function, and cycle-aware constant pool serialization.
    % 2. Added full support for R s-expressions, including closures, promises, environments, vectors, lists, symbols, and builtins.
    % 3. Developed a comprehensive logging suite for debugging bytecode serialization and deserialization.
    % 4. Created a roundtrip test utility which deserializes each function in the R standard library and serializes it back to RDS. Validates the RDS reader and writer by checking that the writer's output for each function matches the original RDS input.
    % 5. Utilized RDS reader and writer to create integration tests for server-side bytecode compilation. For each, the C++ client sends a compilation request to the Java server, including a payload in the form of a standard R package (NAMESPACESXP). The server uses the RDS reader to parse the package, compiles it to bytecode, serializes that bytecode in the GNUR format using the RDS writer, and sends it back to the client. The client then checks whether the bytecode received from the server matches the output of the standard, client-side bytecode compiler. If they do not match, a diff is printed.
